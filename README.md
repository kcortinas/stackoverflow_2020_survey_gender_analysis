## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
The goal of this analysis is to understand diversity in Data Science and assess gender imbalance using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 dataset. In this exploratory analysis, we're interested in answering the following questions:
1. Gender diversity in Data Science (DS) as compared to other tech fields: are there more women in DS? How does the ratio of men/women compare for different developer roles?
2. In Data Science, do women tend to have comparable/more/less coding experience than men?
3. Gender diversity in Data Science (DS) by country: as a woman, where it's easier/harder to get into the field?
4. Are women in Data Science 'over educated'? Do they 'over-invest' in education to get into the field?
5. Are women underpaid in Data Science as compared to men? Do women tend to work overtime?
6. Do women in Data Science code as a hobby? What do they code? Do they prefer R over Python?
7. Are women in Data Science actively looking for a job? What are the reasons of hunt? Do women have different reasons than men?
8. What are the most important factors when considering a job offer? Does this 'valuation' differ by gender?
9. Do women tend to work in smaller companies or large corporations?
